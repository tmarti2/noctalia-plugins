# 🦉 Hyprland Visual Editor (HVE)

### Dynamic Visual Control for Hyprland Customization

**Hyprland Visual Editor** is a professional-grade, non-destructive customization ecosystem for **Hyprland**, built as a native plugin for **Noctalia Shell**. It allows you to instantly change animations, borders, shaders, and geometry, without any risk of corrupting your main `hyprland.conf`.

---

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **🛡️ Guardian Shield** | Deploys a secure external path. If the plugin is disabled, the system self-cleans on reboot. |
| **⚡ Native Integration** | Uses the official Noctalia Plugin API (3.6.0+) for settings and state persistence. |
| **🎬 Motion Library** | Swap between animation styles (Silk, Cyber Glitch, etc.) in milliseconds. |
| **🎨 Smart Borders** | Dynamic gradients and reactive effects tied to window focus. |
| **🕶️ Real-Time Shaders** | Post-processing filters (CRT, OLED, Night) applied on the fly via GLSL. |
| **🌍 Native i18n** | Full multilingual support using Noctalia's native translation engine via `i18n/`. |

## 📂 Project Structure

To ensure maximum stability, HVE follows the official Noctalia plugin architecture:

```text
~/.config/noctalia/
├── HVE/                        # 🛡️ THE SAFE REFUGE (Generated on activation)
│   ├── overlay.conf            # MASTER CONFIG: Sourced directly by Hyprland
│   └── hve_watchdog.sh         # Guardian script for passive auto-cleanup
│
└── plugins/hyprland-visual-editor/
    ├── manifest.json           # Plugin metadata and Entry Points
    ├── BarWidget.qml           # Entry Point: Taskbar trigger icon
    ├── Panel.qml               # Main UI & SmartPanel configuration
    │
    ├── modules/                # UI Components (QML)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Open Noctalia Shell's **Settings** and navigate to the **Plugins** section.
2. Search for **Hyprland Visual Editor** and click **Install**.
3. That's it! Open the plugin panel from your topbar and enjoy customizing your desktop.

> [!NOTE]
> Upon installation, the plugin will automatically and safely inject its configuration path (`source = ~/.cache/noctalia/HVE/overlay.conf`) into your `hyprland.conf`. You don't need to manually edit any files!

---

## ⌨️ IPC & Keybinds (Pro Features)

HVE supports native IPC calls. You can open the panel with a Hyprland keybind:

```bash
bind = $mainMod, V, exec, qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call plugin:hyprland-visual-editor openPanel

```

---

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

HVE uses a **dynamic construction** flow combined with Noctalia's native API:

1. **Native State:** All user preferences are handled via `pluginApi.pluginSettings`.
2. **Dynamic Scanning:** The `scan.sh` script extracts metadata from style headers.
3. **Assembly:** The engine unifies all active fragments into the external `HVE/overlay.conf`.
4. **Protection:** A watchdog script monitors the plugin state on every boot.

## 🛠️ Modding Guide (Metadata Protocol)

To add your own custom styles and have them automatically appear in the panel, use these formats:

### For Animations and Borders (`.conf`)

```ini
# @Title: My Epic Style
# @Icon: rocket
# @Color: #ff0000
# @Tag: CUSTOM
# @Desc: A brief description of your creation.

general {
    col.active_border = rgb(ff0000) rgb(00ff00) 45deg
}

```

### For Shaders (`.frag`)

```glsl
// @Title: Vision Filter
// @Icon: eye
// @Color: #4ade80
// @Tag: NIGHT
// @Desc: Post-processing description.

void main() { ... }

```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**How to see debug logs?**
Launch Noctalia from the terminal to see HVE specific logs:

```bash
NOCTALIA_DEBUG=1 qs -c noctalia-shell | grep HVE

```

**Border animations freeze?**
This is a known Hyprland limitation during hot-reloads. Simply reopen the affected window to restore the loop effect.
